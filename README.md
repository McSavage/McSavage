I'm McSavage. I live in Nashville, TN and identify as a String Bass player.

I am trained in economics, finance and statistics. I came to programming through managing system projects. I know way too much about Microsoft Excel. I spend a lot of time writing SQL in my current job.

I'm interested in Python and algorithmic trading.

I'm currently learning Java. I've always resisted java. I figure it is time. I'm also taking the Coursera/Google certificate in Project Management.
