I'm McSavage. I live in Nashville, TN and identify as a String Bass player.  
I am trained in economics, finance and statistics. I came to programming through managing system projects. I know way too much about Microsoft Excel. I spend a lot of time writing SQL in my current job.  
I'm interested in Python and algorithmic trading.
